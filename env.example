# Environment Variables Template
# Copy this to .env file in your project root

# Netlify Functions URL
# For development: Set to http://localhost:3001/.netlify/functions/google-sheets
# For production: Leave empty (will use /.netlify/functions/google-sheets automatically)
REACT_APP_NETLIFY_FUNCTIONS_URL=

# Note: All Google Sheets credentials are now stored securely in Netlify environment variables
# They are NEVER exposed to the frontend, keeping your app completely secure
# 
# In development mode, the app will use mock data instead of calling Netlify Functions
# This allows you to develop and test the UI without setting up the backend
